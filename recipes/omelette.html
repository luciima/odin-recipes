            <p>Omelette is a super versatile plate that can be enjoyed during any time of the day. You can eat it at breakfast with some juice, or at lunch with some rice or salad.</p>
            <p>The best part is, it is very easy to make. It doesn't take a lot of ingredients, you can use whatever is inside your fridge.</p>
            <p>From the items listed below, the only mandatory one is eggs. The rest are just some ideas of what may be used to fill in the omelette.
                You can also season it with whatever you like. Traditional seasoning includes oregano, salt, and pepper.</p>
